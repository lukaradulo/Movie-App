## A front-end learning project

This is the first project I have worked on in order to learn the latest front-end technologies.

### Stuff I've learned and/or practiced:
- TypeScript and JavaScript
- Writing basic tests
- React Framework along with Redux, Router, etc.
- Hooks such as useState, useEffect, useDispatch, useSelector, useParam, etc.
- useContext hook and creating new contexts for the app theme, and login functionality
- MUI component library
- much more...

I do understand the project structure most certainly has room for improvement.
It's primary function was to learn and practice the latest front-end technologies.
